# How to use the PMax Whisperer Script & Sheet

**There are two key things youâ€™ll need to use this Script/Sheet tool.**

1. The Google Sheet created using the latest version of my PMax Script (currently v52) and,

2. The PMax Whisperer script installed with all your settings completed in the Settings Tab (Get the script on this site!)


### **If you havenâ€™t yet bought my PMax Script, head to [PMaxScript.com](https://mikerhodesidea.wpenginepowered.com/)**

### [**or head straight to the checkout page](https://mikerhodes.circle.so/checkout/latest-script)**

Follow the instructions, get it all setup, then come back here.
Next, install the PMax Whisperer script & copy the **[v7 template sheet here]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C7h9jVfUW83a1rIte0jR9R7vUkfmAPmeh-XZGZC_EpM/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SLEu4Gj3x5UfcyIgWGcqQerV7ej9u38GHifSUZh4wrI/copy)).**

### **Letâ€™s walk through the various settings youâ€™ll need on your Sheet**

**PMax Sheet URL** - the URL of the sheet you created when you setup the latest version of my script (above)

**Choose LLM** - new for v7, choose if you want to use OpenAI or Anthropic

**AI Model to use** - no need to change this, but if you want to save a few pennies, choose 'cheaper' (better means GPT4 or claude3-opus)

**API Key** - donâ€™t worry, youâ€™ll struggle to spend $1/month, but you do need this. Get yours [**OpenAI**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) [**Anthropic**](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api)

**Report**  - choose the report(s) you want, there are 9 options. Have a play & see which you find more useful. New for v7 create multiple reports at once!

**Language** - pick your language from the list (you can type yours over the top of the dropdown if itâ€™s not there!)

**Use Voice?** - do you want to generate an audio version of your chosen report, tick if you do

**Voice** - choose the OpenAI voice youâ€™d like to use. Click the [link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech) to hear samples of each.

**Google Drive Folder ID** - this is where your audio files are sent. Instructions **[here](https://www.notion.so/How-to-find-your-Google-Folder-ID-5d18d0574e244c73aa866c48bae5accd?pvs=21)** Note you must include a folder ID if you want an audio file created (it needs to get saved somewhere)

**Email Output?** - do you want results emailed, tick if you do

**Email to** - enter the email address (just one) of the person you want the output sent to (it might not be possible to send it to yourself)





### Next, install the script in your Google Ads account.

Put the URL of *your* PMax Whisperer sheet between the single quotes at the top (SHEET_URL = â€˜â€™)
Name, Authorise (a couple of times) & Save the script
Hit â€˜Previewâ€™ to run the script & see the logs as they happen - or just hit â€˜Runâ€™
Once itâ€™s working the way you want, schedule the script to run as often as you like (probably daily or weekly)
Your chosen report(s) will be added at the top of the â€˜Outputâ€™ tab (& emailed if you chose that option).
The Audio version will be saved in the Google Folder you choose & a link shown in the logs & in the email & on the Output tab.


### **Get Updates, Make Feature Requests & Say Thanks!**

If youâ€™d like to get a very occasional email from me letting you know when a major update is made to the scripts, drop me your email.
Note, I donâ€™t email every time I update the main script (which is typically every couple of weeks), just major updates.
And I would LOVE to hear how this tool could be better. Iâ€™ve already got lots of ideas, but I always love to hear more.
Please let me know if youâ€™ve got an idea you think would help the majority of users.

And if youâ€™ve read this far - thank you - and please, drop a quick comment onto LinkedIn. Algos & all thatâ€¦ it really helps more people find the tool.


### But what if you donâ€™t have the PMax script? Can you still use the Whisperer?

Yes!! Iâ€™ve added a report option, so that even if you donâ€™t have my latest PMax script, youâ€™ll get value from the Whisperer script.
Just paste the data you want to analyze into the tab â€˜myDataâ€™, choose that report option in Settings & run the script in the normal way ðŸ™‚
Have a look at the 'example myData' tab if you want to copy/paste data for a quick test



Thank you - youâ€™re awesome!
